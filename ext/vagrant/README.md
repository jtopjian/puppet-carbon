This is a simple vagrant environment that can be used for integration testing.

It requires the following:

* Vagrant
* Vagrant LXC plugin
* ZFS
* Vagrant fgrehm/trusty64-lxc box
* Vagrant serverspec plugin

If you don't have or want to use a ZFS-formatted disk, just comment otu the corresponding block in the Vagrantfile.

Similarly, if you want to use a different distribution to test with, edit the Vagrantfile and the `sh/bootstrap.sh` file.

If you require a more robust testing framework, take a look at Test Kitchen.
